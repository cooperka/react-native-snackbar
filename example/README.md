# Snackbar Example

## Usage

1. `npm install`
2. `react-native run-android`

## Troubleshooting

There seem to be some issues with Yarn when running an example project nested in a parent directory
(`Failed to build DependencyGraph: @providesModule naming collision` / `This error is caused by a @providesModule declaration with the same name across two different files`).

If you installed with Yarn, you can simply install with npm afterward and that should resolve things.
